## 🔄 Automation Usage

Each Make.com scenario interacts with one or more sheets:

- Order intake updates **Orders**
- Stock validation reads **Inventory**
- SLA tracking updates **Orders**
- Reporting scenarios write to **Daily_Sales** and **Daily_Summary**

The sheet structure must remain unchanged for automations to work correctly.

## 🔐 Permissions & Safety

- Template access: **Viewer**
- User copies: **Owner**
- No shared editing on the master template

This ensures data integrity and prevents accidental configuration issues.
